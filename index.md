<p class = "paragraph-text text-box"> I am an undergraduate student at BYU. I graduated from MHHS. I am from California and has always enjoyed the sunny areas it has. I have one brother and many cousins and other 
    family members. Throughout college I have dedicated my efforts to learning programming and being the best version of myself that I can be. 
</p>
<div class="spacer"></div>
<p class = "paragraph-text text-box">
    I enjoy programming in a few different languages. I have some experience in python, html, css
    c, and c++. I've also used some other languages like php and SQL. (Check if SQL is a language.) I have also
    made a few projects including a calculator for a company that measures profits and automatically redirects users to a pdf with an invoice, a web scraper, 
    websites with websocket and react features, a doorbell system with cameras and a file system for saving and editing photos, a two factor authentication system for a website and more. 
    I also have experience managing websites (over 100+ sites) and maintaining them with a database.  
</p>

<p class = "paragraph-text text-box">
    In addition to programming I also enjoy other activities like fishing, hiking, reading, games, and more. I also enjoy learning and take many classes to try to learn as much as I can.
